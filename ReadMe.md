#Exploratory Data Science Project 1/4
This Project is attempt to gain a core understanding of data science, having absorbed a lot of materials and tutorials
on the subject matter, decided to create basic analysis of various datasets, even on subject matter that were completely
unfamiliar.

The Project contains analysis based on common libraries, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn, with inline interpretat-
tions, and followed a pattern of:
1. Loading Data
2. Build Data Profiles and Tables
3. Measuring Variables 
4. Exploring Data Relationship

In few cases, i differed a bit where I thought necessary.
It is a simple project anyone can do.
As an amateur, I would incredibly appreciate any support and advice on this project
